WALKS is a Max/MSP 5-channel granular synthesizer

each letter of W A L K S is linked to an audio channel with coordinate-based control over panning and volume

brackets ( ) are linked to master hi-pass/lo-pass filters

digits 1 2 3 4 create a quadrilateral, determining an area of reverb application — the effect is applied to only those channels the letters or which are inside the area

all spatial relations are dynamically tracked — each change in a symbol’s position immediately affects the entire instrument
